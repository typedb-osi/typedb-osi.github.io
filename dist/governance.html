<p>A structured platform for users...</p>
<ul>
<li>to contribute to the TypeDB development roadmap</li>
<li>to contribute to TypeDB server and libraries</li>
<li>to centralise all TypeDB projects as one ecosystem</li>
<li>As a vehicle to organise community projects via the TypeDB Project Incubator</li>
<li>As the support structure to empower a whole new generation of software developers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="typedb-osi-ecosystem">TypeDB OSI Ecosystem</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The TypeDB OSI Ecosystem comprises all resources and technologies to be used with TypeDB. We aim to organise and present these technologies in a consistent format, for ease of implementation and understanding. </p>
<p>Examples of resources and technologies includes but are not limited to client drivers, IDE plug-ins, loaders, visualisers, and resources such as: schema gists by industry, domain, and/or concept, datasets by industry and/or domain, general libraries, blog posts, documentation and educational materials related to the TypeDB ecosystem technologies. </p>
<p>TypeDB OSI Ecosystem technologies can take advantage of early and/or pre-releases of TypeDB in order to understand implications and impact to a maintainers project. Additionally, the internal TypeDB team will be able to better understand the impact of new releases by testing with existing TypeDB Ecosystem projects. </p>
<h3 id="open-problemsprojects">Open problems/projects</h3>
<p>The TypeDB Ecosystem will also address open problems and project opportunities that would enhance or support the efforts by the larger community - whether that is exploring a new language api for an emerging query language, or getting a head start on an IDE plug-in, we will work with the community to maintain an active list of open problems and opportunities. </p>
<h2 id="typedb-osi-incubator">TypeDB OSI Incubator</h2>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p>Nurture TypeDB open source projects to a state of  maturity. Providing the community with production-ready,  high-standard of quality, independent, tools to aid in and accelerate their development. </p>
<p>The TypeDB OSI Incubator will aim to provide maintainers of Incubator projects the ability to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Find community members to contribute in meaningful and productive ways</li>
<li>Raise the visibility of their projects across the user base</li>
<li>Maintain a standard of quality through code quality governance and resources</li>
<li>Ensure continuity of the maintenance and lifetime of the project</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<p>As the TypeDB OSI is intended to provide a platform for innovation and acceleration of development in open-source technologies, participating projects in the TypeDB OSI Incubator will have access to a host of benefits. These are meant to provide more formal guidelines and a support structure not easily obtained as an independent project outside the TypeDB OSI. </p>
<p>These benefits include, but are not limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Access to TypeDB OSI mentors (see TypeDB OSI Governance 8a)  </li>
<li>Github organisation maintenance - by hosting your project repo within the TypeDB OSI organisation (see TypeDB OSI Incubator 3e)</li>
<li>Dedicated Discord channel within Vaticle Community Server (see TypeDB OSI Incubator 3g)</li>
<li>Github organisation wide standards for contribution, including but not limited to: PR and issue submission templates, qa standards and resources</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="new-submission-protocol">New submission protocol</h3>
<p>Protocol for new project submissions into the TypeDB OSI Incubator should be simple for the maintainer, as well as ensure that all new projects adhere to a minimum quality standard shared by all projects within the TypeDB OSI. </p>
<p>The protocol for submitting a new project is as follows - subject to change, by agreement between the TypeDB Committee Leadership: </p>
<ol>
<li>Submit request via typedb.org submission form. </li>
<li>New submission assigned to a TypeDB OSI Leader who then checks:<ol>
<li>Does the project meet prerequisites? (see [TypeDB OSI Incubator: Quality Standards](#Quality standards))</li>
<li>Once the project meets all prerequisites, the maintainer will be informed via email and invited into the github.com/typedb-osi organisation </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Maintainer should then create or move repo to <a href="https://github.com/typedb-osi">github.com/typedb-osi organisation</a><ol>
<li>If a repo already exists and maintainer would like to keep the repo in its existing location, based on existing user base and impact </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Once a repo has been created, a discord channel will be created and maintainer will be given [typedb-osi-project-name] role</li>
<li>Maintainer and TypeDB OSI will work together to schedule an introduction talk with the community, to introduce the project to the wider TypeDB Community  </li>

<h2 id="typedb-osi-contributor-guidelines">TypeDB OSI Contributor Guidelines</h2>
<p>A TypeDB OSI Contributor is someone who makes consistent improvements to TypeDB, TypeDB OSI Incubator or TypeDB OSI Ecosystem projects. </p>
<h3 id="becoming-a-typedb-osi-contributor">Becoming a TypeDB OSI Contributor</h3>
<p>All individuals who wish to contribute to TypeDB OSI projects and/or repos need to have a signed contributor agreement on file with TypeDB OSI. </p>
<h3 id="contributor-agreements">Contributor Agreements</h3>
<p>The TypeDB OSI  uses various agreements to accept regular contributions from individuals and corporations, and to accept larger grants of existing software technologies.</p>
<p>These agreements help us achieve our goal of providing reliable and long-lived software technologies through collaborative open source software development. In all cases, contributors retain full rights to use their original contributions for any other purpose outside of TypeDB OSI while providing the TypeDB OSI and its projects the right to distribute and build upon their work within TypeDB OSI</p>
<h4 id="contributor-license-agreements">Contributor License Agreements</h4>
<p>The TypeDB OSI desires that all contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to any TypeDB OSI projects complete, sign, and submit via email an Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA).</p>
<p>The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to the TypeDB OSI and thereby allow us to defend the project should there be a legal dispute regarding the software at some future time. A signed ICLA is required to be on file before an individual is given commit rights to any TypeDB OSI project.</p>
<p>For a corporation that has assigned employees to work on an TypeDB OSI project, a Corporate CLA (CCLA) is available for contributing intellectual property via the corporation, that may have been assigned as part of an employment agreement.</p>
<p>Note that a Corporate CLA does not remove the need for every developer to sign their own ICLA as an individual, which covers both contributions which are owned and those that are not owned by the corporation signing the CCLA.</p>
<p>The CCLA legally binds the corporation, so it must be signed by a person with authority to enter into legal contracts on behalf of the corporation.</p>
<p>The ICLA is not tied to any employer you may have, so it is recommended to use one&#39;s personal email address in the contact details, rather than an @work address.</p>
<p>Your full name will be published unless you provide an alternative public name. For example if your full name is Alfred North Whitehead, but you wish to be known as Al Whitehead, please enter the latter as your Public name. Your Full name should be written with your given name first and your family name last, though your preferred ordering can be used in the Public name.</p>
<p>The email address and other contact details are not published.</p>
<p>If you are submitting an ICLA in response to an invitation from a TypeDB OSI Committee member, be sure to identify the project via the form field &quot;notify project&quot;. Also, choose a preferred id that is not already in use. Apache ids must start with an alphabetic character and contain at least two additional alphanumeric characters (no special characters). </p>
